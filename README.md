# Pyro

Pyro is a semi-automated incremental build system for _Skyrim Classic_ (TESV), _Skyrim Special Edition_ (SSE), and _Fallout 4_ (FO4) projects. Pyro makes quick work of the process for creating new builds of mods for those games.

Fundamentally, Pyro is a command-line interface (CLI) that parses customized Papyrus Project (PPJ) files into actionable data and passes that data to Bethesda Softworks' Papyrus Compiler and zilav's BSArch.

Pyro automates most build tasks and can play a key role in an automated build and release pipeline. Pyro can also be integrated as an external tool within virtually any IDE, allowing modders to build their projects with a single hotkey.

### Multiple Game Support

Pyro supports the TESV, SSE, and FO4 compilers.

When the game is switched, all paths are generated using the `Installed Path` key in the Windows Registry for the respective games.

You can also set a path explicitly in `pyro.ini` if you are on a non-Windows platform.


### Extended PPJ Format

The PPJ format was introduced with the FO4 version of the Papyrus Compiler, which was not backported to TESV and SSE. Pyro can parse all standard PPJ elements and attributes, in addition to several of its own, for TESV, SSE, and FO4 projects.


#### Elements

Element | Support
:--- | :---
`<PapyrusProject>` | This element and its `Flags`, `Output`, `Optimize`, `Release` (FO4 only), and `Final` (FO4 only) attributes are supported. The new `Archive`, `CreateArchive`, and `Anonymize` attributes are also required.
`<Imports>` | This element and its children `<Import>` contain absolute paths to a game's base scripts, a mod's user scripts, and third-party SDK scripts.
`<Scripts>` | This element and its children `<Script>` contain absolute or relative paths to a mod's user scripts.
`<Folders>` | This element and its children `<Folder>` contain absolute or relative paths to folders containing a mod's user scripts. The parent element's `NoRecurse` attribute is also supported.
`<Includes>` | This new element and its children `<Include>` contain relative paths to arbitrary files to be packaged in the mod's BSA or BA2 archive. The parent element has a `Root` attribute that contains the absolute path to the root of the relative Include paths.


#### Attributes

Element | Attribute | Data Type | Value
:--- | :--- | :--- | :---
PapyrusProject | Flags | String | file name with extension
PapyrusProject | Output | String | absolute path to folder
PapyrusProject | Optimize | Boolean | true or false
PapyrusProject | Release | Boolean | true or false
PapyrusProject | Final | Boolean | true or false
PapyrusProject | Archive | String | absolute path to file name with extension
PapyrusProject | CreateArchive | Boolean | true or false
PapyrusProject | Anonymize | Boolean | true or false
Folders | NoRecurse | Boolean | true or false
Includes | Root | String | absolute path to folder


### Incremental Build with Parallelized Compilation

Incremental build _vastly_ accelerates builds by compiling only scripts that need to be compiled.

Here's how the incremental build system works:

1. After the first successful run, Pyro builds an index for that project containing the file paths and CRC32 hashes of those files.
2. When generating commands for the next run, the CRC32 hashes of those files are compared with the indexed file records.
3. Commands are not generated for matching records, reducing the work passed on to the compiler.
4. Checksum records are updated for previously indexed scripts that have been modified and successfully compiled.
5. New checksum records are created for new scripts that have been successfully compiled.

In addition, Pyro will spawn multiple instances of the Papyrus Compiler in parallel to further reduce build times.


#### Benchmarks

The native PPJ compiler for FO4 is on average 70 ms faster per script. Tested with i5-3570k @ 3.4 GHz and 6 scripts.

However, there is no native PPJ compiler for TESV and SSE. Pyro fills that role.


### Automatic BSA/BA2 Packaging

You can package scripts into BSA and BA2 archives with [BSArch](https://www.nexusmods.com/newvegas/mods/64745).

1. Set the path to `bsarch.exe` in `pyro.ini`.
2. Add the `Archive` attribute to the `PapyrusProject` root element. Set the value to the absolute path to the destination BSA or BA2 archive.
3. Add the `CreateArchive` attribute to the `PapyrusProject` root element. Set the value to `True`.
4. Compile as normal and the compiled scripts will be automatically packaged.

To package arbitrary files, add the following block before the `</PapyrusProject>` end tag:

```xml
<Includes Root="{absolute path to project root}">
	<Include>{relative path to file in project root}</Include>
	<Include>{...}</Include>
</Includes>
```

Currently, folder includes are not supported.


#### Notes

* A temporary folder will be created and deleted at the `TempPath` specified in `pyro.ini`.
* The compiled scripts and any arbitrary includes to be packaged will be copied to the temporary folder.
* The temporary folder will be removed if the procedure is successful.


### Script Anonymization

When a script is compiled, your system username and computer name are embedded in the binary header. This information can be revealed with a hex editor or decompiler. If your username is your real name, or you are concerned about targeted attacks using your system login, leaving this information intact can present security and/or privacy risks.

Pyro replaces those strings in compiled scripts with random letters, effectively anonymizing compiled scripts.

Simply add the `Anonymize` attribute to the `PapyrusProject` root element. Set the value to `True`.

### Packages

- API: The `pyro` package includes all the necessary functionality for the CLI.
- CLI: The `pyro_cli` package can be executed directly on the command line.


### Compiling

Install pipenv if you don't already have it:

`pip install pipenv`
or
`conda install -c conda-forge pipenv` (if using anaconda)

Set up the pipenv environment:

`pipenv install`

The build process uses [Nuitka](https://nuitka.net/) which will be installed in your pipenv environment by pipenv. Nuitka will need either **clang**, **mingw**, or **MSVC**. If you want to use MSVC then you'll need to run the next command from a MSVC developer shell.

Run the build script:

`pipenv run python build.py`

This will create a `pyro_cli.dist` directory with the exe and all the stuff needed to run it, and it will place a zip archive of this directory in a `bin` directory.
